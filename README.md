# Home Assistant Netgear Integration


The `Netgear` [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) integration allows you to integrate your Netgear access
points into Home Assistant. Today this integration supports the WAX device models but is coded to make it easy to add
other devices, simply implement the NetgearClient interface.

Supports turning on WI-FI SSIDs. This is particular useful if you want to automate turning on your guest WI-FI network.
